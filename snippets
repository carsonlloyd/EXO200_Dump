Here is some random stuff that might be helpful, but wasn't big enough to be on its own:

Make sure you have this in your shell source file on the SLAC server (~/.cshrc or ~/.bashrc etc.): source /nfs/slac/g/exo/software/hudson/builds-rhel6-64/trunk/setup.csh

Make yourself a directory on the SLAC servers in /nfs/slac/g/exo/. (For instance, mine is /nfs/slac/g/exo/clloyd/.)
The disk(s) that directory is on are made for data (more storage and I think faster). You should do any heavy data runs or script running to that location, thus most of your work will happen here, not your natural home directory

.
