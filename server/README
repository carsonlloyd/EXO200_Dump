This directory holds scripts that should be run (and stored) on the SLAC servers.

The *build* scripts are to create ROOT data sets with certain initial filters.

The *create* scripts are to perform cuts on those initial data sets.

In other words, the build scripts filter on RUNS and the create scripts filter on EVENTS.
